### Goals:
# Get Camera Config From Camera
	#use object oriented approach to list all the children in an iterable list, (I can do this!)

# Show a "Live Preview, at 10fps"
	#Help? 

# Allow user to use the keyboard to update:
	#Exposure (e to incr, E to decr)
	#ISO (i to incr, I to decr)
	#Apeture (a to incr, A to decr)
	#Pull this from an enumerated list 

# Update the desired values (if the user chooses to save) to the camera
# Exit the Camera Configurator
